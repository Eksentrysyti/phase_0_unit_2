# U2.W4: Cipher Challenge


# I worked on this challenge with: .



# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing. 
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.

# Reflection

# The hardest part of the challenge is going through the original code and figuring out what each part was trying to do.  There was a lot of redundancy and roundabout ways of doing things in this piece of code and it took a bit of commenting to figure out the purpose of each line.  Once the purpose of each section was figured out, it was simple to cut out redundancy and trying to combine tasks into one.
